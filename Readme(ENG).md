## [Project 1 - Personal project](https://github.com/RudkovYaroslav/spotify_project)

During a break in my studies, I started my first own project. It became interesting to analyze data on artists and their works on spotify. During the course of the project:
- Used the even more advanced functionality of pandas, including knowledge of python, to create my own algorithms to cull certain data
- Conducted an exploratory analysis to assess the overall state of the industry, as well as to establish the dependencies of various qualities of music tracks on their popularity.
- Noted the growing trend of utilization of streaming services, as well as the low market saturation at the moment.
- Drew conclusions on the results of the analysis

## [Project 2 - Selenium_Riot](https://github.com/RudkovYaroslav/Selenium_Riot)

My second pet project. The main goal is to simplify the fulfillment of the achievement in the game League of Legends. To achieve this goal, I parced a site to collect statistics and then compiled all the information I received into an excel file. During the course of the project:
- Faced many problems parsing websites, specifically [op.gg](https://op.gg)
- Using Selenium libraries and then BeautifulSoup, was able to open the right pages to gather information
- Sorted and transformed the information in the collected dataframes
- Transferred all results to an excel file

## [Project 1 - Research analysis](https://github.com/RudkovYaroslav/research_analysis?tab=readme-ov-file)

The first independent project, which is done in Jupyter Notebook. The main goal is to show basic skills in data preprocessing and research analysis. During the project:
- Using the pandas library examined the DataFrame that was provided
- Did preprocessing as the data in the provided  DataFrame was very “raw”
- Carried out an exploratory analysis to find out the dependencies of apartment parameters on their price.
- Based on the data obtained, conclusions were drawn and recommendations were made

## [Project 2 - Statistical analysis](https://github.com/RudkovYaroslav/project_2)

The second project, done also in Jupyter Notebook. During the project:
- As before, performed a pre-processing and research analysis
- The analysis demonstrated knowledge of the matplotlib library for plotting graphs
- Used concepts from probability theory to perform statistical analysis
- Considered some pre-specified hypotheses. Using the functionality of the scipy library, as well as the concept of p value, drew conclusions in favor of disproving or not disproving the hypotheses.
- Drew conclusions and recommendations based on the analysis performed

## [Project 3 - Assembled](https://github.com/RudkovYaroslav/project_gaming)

A third project that reflects knowledge of the entire data analysis unit in Python. It included:
- Using the pandas library at an advanced level
- Using the seaborn library and matplotlib to plot graphs
- Using the numpy and scipy libraries to perform statistical analysis
During the project:
- Conducted an exploratory analysis of the past state of the gaming industry
- Based on the trends in the past tried to predict the most possible variants of the development of this area in the near future
- Evaluated profitable platforms, genres of video games to invest in advertising
- Drew conclusions and made recommendations for the company based on the conducted analysis

## [Project 4 - Business analysis](https://github.com/RudkovYaroslav/project_business)

The fourth project is aimed at studying business aspects, specifically analyzing advertising costs in order to find weaknesses. In the course of the analysis:
- “raw” data was taken about users, channels of their attraction, as well as the cost of these channels and, importantly, the profit from users
- After preprocessing, I made portraits of each specific user
- Conducted exploratory analysis on these portraits to find basic correlations.
- Analyzed the business metrics of advertising costs. In the course of it, I looked at Retentinon Rate/ Churn Rate of users in general, as well as by channel.
- Also analyzed LTV, CAC, ROI by country and channel. During the analysis I was able to identify ineffective channels of attraction
- I drew conclusions and made recommendations to the business to improve the state of advertising for the company

## [Project 5 - Advanced Hypothesis Analysis](https://github.com/RudkovYaroslav/Advanced_business_analysis)

The fifth project took a more in-depth dive into the very essence of conducting A/B tests, where a case study had to examine two groups and draw a conclusion as to whether to continue with the test or discontinue. During the course of the project:
- The input was a table with hypothesis data, the number of users from each group on certain dates, and the orders that these users composed
- After preprocessing, performed prioritization of hypotheses by ICE, RICE frameworks
- Proceeded to analyze the A/B test, namely:
   - Graphically showed the difference between groups in terms of average check, number of orders, and relative values
   - I took into account the abnormal values in these groups.
   - Conducted Mann-Whitney tests on “raw” and “clean” data, drew conclusions on the results obtained
- As a result, I made a general conclusion, in which I decided to stop the test in view of the success of one of the groups both on the graphs and in stat tests
