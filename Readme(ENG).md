# My portfolio

# [Project 1 - Research analysis](https://github.com/RudkovYaroslav/research_analysis/blob/main/research_analysis.ipynb)

The first independent project, which is done in Jupyter Notebook. The main goal is to show basic skills in data preprocessing and research analysis. During the project:
- Using the pandas library examined the DataFrame that was provided
- Did preprocessing as the data in the provided  DataFrame was very “raw”
- Carried out an exploratory analysis to find out the dependencies of apartment parameters on their price.
- Based on the data obtained, conclusions were drawn and recommendations were made

# [Project 2 - Statistical analysis](https://github.com/RudkovYaroslav/project_2/blob/main/project_bykes_GoFast.ipynb)

The second project, done also in Jupyter Notebook. During the project:
- As before, performed a pre-processing and research analysis
- The analysis demonstrated knowledge of the matplotlib library for plotting graphs
- Used concepts from probability theory to perform statistical analysis
- Considered some pre-specified hypotheses. Using the functionality of the scipy library, as well as the concept of p value, drew conclusions in favor of disproving or not disproving the hypotheses.
- Drew conclusions and recommendations based on the analysis performed

# [Project 3 - Assembled](https://github.com/RudkovYaroslav/project_gaming/blob/main/Игровая_индустрия_1980_2016.ipynb)

A third project that reflects knowledge of the entire data analysis unit in Python. It included:
- Using the pandas library at an advanced level
- Using the seaborn library and matplotlib to plot graphs
- Using the numpy and scipy libraries to perform statistical analysis
During the project:
- Conducted an exploratory analysis of the past state of the gaming industry
- Based on the trends in the past tried to predict the most possible variants of the development of this area in the near future
- Evaluated profitable platforms, genres of video games to invest in advertising
- Drew conclusions and made recommendations for the company based on the conducted analysis

# [Project 4 - Personal project](https://github.com/RudkovYaroslav/spotify_project/blob/main/Spotify.ipynb)

During a break in my studies, I started my own project. It became interesting to analyze data on artists and their works on spotify. During the course of the project:
- Used the even more advanced functionality of pandas, including knowledge of python, to create my own algorithms to cull certain data
- Conducted an exploratory analysis to assess the overall state of the industry, as well as to establish the dependencies of various qualities of music tracks on their popularity.
- Noted the growing trend of utilization of streaming services, as well as the low market saturation at the moment.
- Drew conclusions on the results of the analysis

# [Project 5 - Business analysis](https://github.com/RudkovYaroslav/project_business/blob/main/Business_analysis.ipynb)

The fifth project is aimed at studying business aspects, specifically analyzing advertising costs in order to find weaknesses. In the course of the analysis:
- “raw” data was taken about users, channels of their attraction, as well as the cost of these channels and, importantly, the profit from users
- After preprocessing, I made portraits of each specific user
- Conducted exploratory analysis on these portraits to find basic correlations.
- Analyzed the business metrics of advertising costs. In the course of it, I looked at Retentinon Rate/ Churn Rate of users in general, as well as by channel.
- Also analyzed LTV, CAC, ROI by country and channel. During the analysis I was able to identify ineffective channels of attraction
- I drew conclusions and made recommendations to the business to improve the state of advertising for the company
