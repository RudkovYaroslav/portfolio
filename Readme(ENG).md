## [Project 1 - Personal project](https://github.com/RudkovYaroslav/spotify_project)

During a break in my studies, I started my first own project. It became interesting to analyze data on artists and their works on spotify. During the course of the project:
- Used the even more advanced functionality of pandas, including knowledge of python, to create my own algorithms to cull certain data
- Conducted an exploratory analysis to assess the overall state of the industry, as well as to establish the dependencies of various qualities of music tracks on their popularity.
- Noted the growing trend of utilization of streaming services, as well as the low market saturation at the moment.
- Drew conclusions on the results of the analysis

## [Project 2 - Selenium_Riot](https://github.com/RudkovYaroslav/Selenium_Riot)

My second pet project. The main goal is to simplify the fulfillment of the achievement in the game League of Legends. To achieve this goal, I parced a site to collect statistics and then compiled all the information I received into an excel file. During the course of the project:
- Faced many problems parsing websites, specifically [op.gg](https://op.gg)
- Using Selenium libraries and then BeautifulSoup, was able to open the right pages to gather information
- Sorted and transformed the information in the collected dataframes
- Transferred all results to an excel file

## [Project 1 - Research analysis](https://github.com/RudkovYaroslav/research_analysis?tab=readme-ov-file)

The first independent project, which is done in Jupyter Notebook. The main goal is to show basic skills in data preprocessing and research analysis. During the project:
- Using the pandas library examined the DataFrame that was provided
- Did preprocessing as the data in the provided  DataFrame was very “raw”
- Carried out an exploratory analysis to find out the dependencies of apartment parameters on their price.
- Based on the data obtained, conclusions were drawn and recommendations were made

## [Project 2 - Statistical analysis](https://github.com/RudkovYaroslav/project_2)

The second project, done also in Jupyter Notebook. During the project:
- As before, performed a pre-processing and research analysis
- The analysis demonstrated knowledge of the matplotlib library for plotting graphs
- Used concepts from probability theory to perform statistical analysis
- Considered some pre-specified hypotheses. Using the functionality of the scipy library, as well as the concept of p value, drew conclusions in favor of disproving or not disproving the hypotheses.
- Drew conclusions and recommendations based on the analysis performed

## [Project 3 - Assembled](https://github.com/RudkovYaroslav/project_gaming)

A third project that reflects knowledge of the entire data analysis unit in Python. It included:
- Using the pandas library at an advanced level
- Using the seaborn library and matplotlib to plot graphs
- Using the numpy and scipy libraries to perform statistical analysis
During the project:
- Conducted an exploratory analysis of the past state of the gaming industry
- Based on the trends in the past tried to predict the most possible variants of the development of this area in the near future
- Evaluated profitable platforms, genres of video games to invest in advertising
- Drew conclusions and made recommendations for the company based on the conducted analysis

## [Project 4 - Business analysis](https://github.com/RudkovYaroslav/project_business)

The fourth project is aimed at studying business aspects, specifically analyzing advertising costs in order to find weaknesses. In the course of the analysis:
- “raw” data was taken about users, channels of their attraction, as well as the cost of these channels and, importantly, the profit from users
- After preprocessing, I made portraits of each specific user
- Conducted exploratory analysis on these portraits to find basic correlations.
- Analyzed the business metrics of advertising costs. In the course of it, I looked at Retentinon Rate/ Churn Rate of users in general, as well as by channel.
- Also analyzed LTV, CAC, ROI by country and channel. During the analysis I was able to identify ineffective channels of attraction
- I drew conclusions and made recommendations to the business to improve the state of advertising for the company

## [Project 5 - Advanced Hypothesis Analysis](https://github.com/RudkovYaroslav/Advanced_business_analysis)

The fifth project took a more in-depth dive into the very essence of conducting A/B tests, where a case study had to examine two groups and draw a conclusion as to whether to continue with the test or discontinue. During the course of the project:
- The input was a table with hypothesis data, the number of users from each group on certain dates, and the orders that these users composed
- After preprocessing, performed prioritization of hypotheses by ICE, RICE frameworks
- Proceeded to analyze the A/B test, namely:
   - Graphically showed the difference between groups in terms of average check, number of orders, and relative values
   - I took into account the abnormal values in these groups.
   - Conducted Mann-Whitney tests on “raw” and “clean” data, drew conclusions on the results obtained
- As a result, I made a general conclusion, in which I decided to stop the test in view of the success of one of the groups both on the graphs and in stat tests

## [Project 6 - Moscow Catering Market](https://github.com/RudkovYaroslav/Moscow_catering_industry)

The sixth project is devoted to visualization and many aspects related to it. On the case study, using real data of Moscow catering establishments it was necessary with the help of visualizations to provide the most understandable information to the customer on a specific request, having previously studied the data. In the course of the project:
- Took data on the state of the Moscow catering market for 2022
- During EDA analyzed the data in order to find the most important parameters in the basis of the establishment
- Based on the graphs(Also geographical data), drew intermediate conclusions before proceeding to solve the problem from the customer:
  - Reviewed the important aspects found earlier in order to establish a coffee shop
  - Found the criteria that should be relied on when founding this type of establishment.
  - Gave recommendations on these criteria
- As a result, I drew a general conclusion and also prepared a presentation for the customer.

## [Project 7 - Working in Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jessie.mccree/viz/Practicum_Viz/sheet21?publish=yes)
The seventh project was completely done in Tableau. The task was to build several dashboards based on TED talks, divided into topics. While working on the dashboards:
- Various graphical representations of information were prepared
- Tableau functionality on interaction between charts (Action) was realized.
- Worked on the stylistics of the prepared dashboards to make them look visually convenient and beautiful.
- Derived the most important information, which may be of interest to the customer or the average user, from the provided data.

## [Project 8(Graduation) - “Telecom” Finding sub-optimal rate customers](https://github.com/RudkovYaroslav/graduation_project)

Graduation project summarizes all the knowledge in data analytics that I learned in the course. A case study that is as close to the real world as possible. The task was to provide to customer a brief squeeze of the available data and show the findings in a presentation. During the project:
- Used data on telecom provider's clients, their tariffs and the tariff plans themselves
- After extensive preprocessing, performed exploratory analysis to find interesting dependencies, and prepared and aggregated data to calculate client costs by tariffs
- I was able to combine the information and derive a generalized average value of customer costs, which could be used to calculate the percentage of users who use suboptimal tariffs.
- Prepared the obtained information in a convenient form for the customer, as well as created informative visualizations of the findings
- Tested the hypotheses set by the customer before starting the study
- Compiled a general conclusion and prepared presentation material to be presented to the customer
